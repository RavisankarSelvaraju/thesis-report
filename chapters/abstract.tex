Traditional dead-reckoning odometry approaches are prone to significant errors due to sensor drift and unaccounted wheel slippage on loose terrains such as sand and gravel. This thesis proposes an improved odometry solution using sensor fusion within an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework. The approach utilizes a Potential Contact Velocity (PCV) based update model combined with a slip filtering mechanism to detect and discard erroneous wheel measurements when slippage occurs. By monitoring the consistency between Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and wheel encoder data, the system aims to exclude wheel encoder data with slip from the state estimation process. The performance of this slip-aware framework will be evaluated against the current baseline odometry through simulations on inclined terrains and real-world experiments with the Coyote 3 rover, utilizing metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and error per unit distance.}
